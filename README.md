## According to the source oh www.history.com stated, "on July 5, 1994, Princeton graduate and entrepreneur Jeff Bezos founds Cadabra -- a twisted version of the magic word "abracadabra". Which is actually just an online bookstore that he ran out of his garage in Bellevue, Washington. Bezos later changes the name to Amazon, and his site grows to become a global retail giant, an online "everything store" earning hundreds of millions in annual sales."
